# Extending Neural Cleanse to Discrete Domain

[Neural Cleanse](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/publications/pdf/backdoor-sp19.pdf) (IEEE S&P 2019) describes a detection tool against backdoor (Trojan) attacks on deep neural networks in vision domain. Can it be extended to the discrete domain such as binary-valued vectors, text, and code?

After experiments and exploration, my answer is: Yes.
